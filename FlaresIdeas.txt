Finding separate most discriminative features:

compute featuresets: big, oos

then for every feature f, and decision_function in (mean, median, std), compute ratios decision_function(f(big))/decision_function(f(big)), sort features by ratios.


ACTIVE LEARNING:

out of limited # of known flares, create much wider simulated set when only parts of the series are left, or random parts are missing (simulate non-observation periods)
